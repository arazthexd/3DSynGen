# 3DSynGen
Just a new public repository for my thesis. Like, who would ever want to steal my code, right? :D

# TODO
Primary model results satisfactory. The next steps:
- [ ] 3D geometry as conditions for the model
- [ ] Dimensionality reduction and preprocessing of molecule/reaction featurizers
- [ ] Discuss potential transfer learning from relevant models
- [ ] Use of rxnfp or drfp for featurizing reactions (not reaction templates!)
